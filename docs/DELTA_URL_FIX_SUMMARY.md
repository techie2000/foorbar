# Delta URL Parsing Fix - Summary

## Issue
The backend service was showing empty `delta_url` when fetching the latest GLEIF file URLs, even though the GLEIF API was returning the correct data. This prevented automatic delta file downloads from working.

## Root Cause
Multiple overlapping Docker Compose projects were running simultaneously (`axiom-dev-*` and `axiom3-*` containers), causing:
- Old container images to be used instead of newly built ones
- Environment variable conflicts
- Container name collisions
- Cached binaries from previous builds running instead of updated code

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. **Data Directory Organization**
- Created `./data/lei/` directory for LEI file storage
- Moved all downloaded files from root to proper directory
- Already excluded via `.gitignore` (`/data/` pattern)

### 2. **Documentation Updates**
Updated [LEI_QUICKSTART.md](LEI_QUICKSTART.md):
- **Scheduler Clarification**: Explained that LEI scheduler is embedded in backend service (not a separate 5th container)
- **GLEIF API Details**: Added section explaining the discovery endpoint structure
- **Data Formats**: Documented differences between bulk file format (used here) and single LEI API query format
- **Data Directory**: Added explanation of `./data/lei/` storage location

### 3. **Code Fixes**
- Fixed logging syntax errors in `lei_service.go` (removed orphaned method calls after `Msg()`)
- Added comprehensive debug logging to show both Full and Delta URLs with size/record counts
- Added debug message showing empty string detection: `(full empty: false, delta empty: false)`

### 4. **Environment Cleanup**
- Stopped and removed all conflicting Docker containers
- Rebuilt backend with `--no-cache` flag
- Started fresh with single compose project

### 5. **Verification**
Created standalone test program to verify struct definitions work correctly (proved structs were correct, issue was environment-related).

## Current Status: ✅ **WORKING**

### Verified Output
```json
{
  "level":"info",
  "full_url":"https://goldencopy.gleif.org/storage/golden-copy-files/2026/02/11/1189144/20260211-0800-gleif-goldencopy-lei2-golden-copy.json.zip",
  "full_size":909033722,
  "full_records":3209464,
  "delta_url":"https://goldencopy.gleif.org/storage/golden-copy-files/2026/02/11/1189168/20260211-0800-gleif-goldencopy-lei2-last-week.json.zip",
  "delta_size":13731936,
  "delta_records":58533,
  "time":1770810971,
  "caller":"/app/internal/service/lei_service.go:144",
  "message":"Retrieved latest file information (full empty: false, delta empty: false)"
}
```

Both Full and Delta URLs are now correctly parsed from the GLEIF API response.

## Files Modified
1. `backend/internal/service/lei_service.go` - Fixed logging, added debug output
2. `docs/LEI_QUICKSTART.md` - Added scheduler, API, and format documentation
3. `./data/lei/` - Created and populated with downloaded files

## Testing Recommendations
1. Monitor scheduler logs for successful delta file downloads
2. Verify delta sync runs hourly without errors
3. Check that delta files are downloaded to `./data/lei/`
4. Confirm database updates from delta files

## Lessons Learned
- **Docker Compose Projects**: Always ensure only one compose project is active to avoid container conflicts
- **Container Cleanup**: Use `docker stop $(docker ps -aq)` and `docker rm $(docker ps -aq)` to fully clean environment
- **Build Caching**: Sometimes `--no-cache` isn't enough; full environment cleanup is needed
- **Debugging Strategy**: Create standalone test programs to isolate issues (proved struct definitions were correct)
- **PowerShell Output**: `Write-Host` doesn't appear in VS Code terminal; use `Write-Output` or plain strings instead

## Next Steps
1. ✅ Delta URL parsing working
2. ⏭️ Monitor automatic delta sync execution
3. ⏭️ Verify delta file processing updates LEI records correctly
4. ⏭️ Test full sync weekly schedule
5. ⏭️ Add monitoring/alerting for failed syncs
